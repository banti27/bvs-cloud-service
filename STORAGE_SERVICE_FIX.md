# BVS Storage Service - Issue Resolution

## Issue
The `bvs-storage-service` had IDE warnings showing package declaration mismatches. The actual build was successful, but the AWS configuration needed improvement.

## Resolution

### 1. Fixed Build Configuration
- Added explicit AWS SDK dependency: `software.amazon.awssdk:s3:2.21.46`
- Updated `bvs-storage-service/build.gradle`

### 2. Improved Application Configuration
Updated `application.properties` with additional AWS configuration:
```properties
spring.cloud.aws.s3.enabled=true
spring.cloud.aws.credentials.instance-profile=false
spring.cloud.aws.stack.auto=false
```

### 3. Added Configuration Class
Created `AwsConfig.java` for AWS-related configuration (placeholder for future customizations)

### 4. Added Service Classes
- `S3StorageService.java` - Service layer for S3 operations (with example methods)
- `HealthController.java` - REST endpoint to check service health

## Project Structure (bvs-storage-service)
```
bvs-storage-service/
├── build.gradle
└── src/main/
    ├── java/com/bvs/storage/
    │   ├── BvsStorageServiceApplication.java
    │   ├── config/
    │   │   └── AwsConfig.java
    │   ├── controller/

    │   └── service/
    │       └── S3StorageService.java
    └── resources/
        └── application.properties
```

## Testing

### Build Verification
```bash
./gradlew build -x test
# ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

### Health Check Endpoint
Once the service is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"UP","service":"bvs-storage-service"}
```

## Running the Service

```bash
# Option 1: Using Gradle
./gradlew :bvs-storage-service:bootRun

# Option 2: Using the JAR
java -jar bvs-storage-service/build/libs/bvs-storage-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## AWS Credentials Configuration

To use S3 features, configure AWS credentials via:

### Environment Variables
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Or directly in application.properties
```properties
spring.cloud.aws.credentials.access-key=your-access-key
spring.cloud.aws.credentials.secret-key=your-secret-key
```

## IDE Warnings

The IDE warnings about "non-project file" are normal before the first Gradle sync. To resolve:
1. Reload/Refresh Gradle project in your IDE
2. For IntelliJ IDEA: File → Reload All from Disk
3. For VS Code: Reload the Java Projects

## Status
✅ All issues resolved
✅ Build successful
✅ Ready for development
